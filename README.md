## ANN in Condition-based Predictive Maintenance (dissertation project)

### Abstract
  This research is through cooperation with AGM plc. to explore the application of pump using ANN for Condition-based Predictive Maintenance (CBPM). Vibration monitoring of pump is carried out by using vibration sensor. And use the data obtained from the monitoring records to make the vibration velocity of the pump on the X, Y and Z axis in the next 6 hours. Then use the classification model to distinguish the normal or abnormal operation status of the pump and use ISO 10861 as the comparison benchmark.

### Research Aims and Objectives
* Aims
 1. Use vibration signal monitoring technology to perform CBPM.
 2. Use ANN methods to forecast the results and perform damage prediction of pump set.
* Objectives
 1. Define the method of monitoring vibration signals for the application of CBPM
 2. Collect and analyze the vibration signals in the time domain and frequency domain
 3. Explore and test the impact of ANN architecture and parameter settings on predicting the results.
